# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.
dist_6h = float(0)
dist_10h = float(0)
dist_15h = float(0)

# Constant for the speed.
SPEED_MPH = 10

# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.
dist_6h = SPEED_MPH * 6
dist_10h = SPEED_MPH * 10
dist_15h = SPEED_MPH * 15

# Print the results for all calculations.
print ("Distance for 6 hours:", dist_6h ,"\nDistance for 10 hours:", dist_10h  ,"\nDistance for 15 hours:", dist_15h )
