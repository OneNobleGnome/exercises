# Programming Exercise 4-1
#
# Program to total the values of five integers.
# This program the user for an integer five times,
# and totals them up,
# then displays the total entered on the screen.

int_1 = input("enter an int to sum:   ")
int_2 = input("enter an int to sum:   ")
int_3 = input("enter an int to sum:   ")
int_4 = input("enter an int to sum:   ")
int_5 = input("enter an int to sum:   ")

# Initialize variables for bugs collected and total bugs.
# be sure to initialize them as integers




# Get the number of bugs collected from the user
# use a for loop to get the number of bugs exactly five times, once for each day


	# input bugs collected on this day and convert it to an int

    
    # add bugs collected to total bugs


# Display the total number of bugs collected for all five days.
